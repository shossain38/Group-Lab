# Rock, Paper Scissors Game:
### The game consists of two players and three different hand symbols-
### The player can count to 3 or they can say rock/paper/scissor and present their hand symbol to the opponent. Each hand symbol has its strength and weaknesses.
### Rock is symbolised by a clenched fist, scissor is a horizontal V and paper is a horizontal straight hand.
### Rock defeats scissor â€“ it can crush the scissor 
### Scissor defeats paper- The scissor can cut the paper
### Paper defeats rock- The paper can cover up the rock.
### The outcome will be either win, loss, or tie.
### Whatever hand symbols are presented by the players, will result in an outcome.
## 1.If two players show the same symbol the game is tied then it will go to the second scenario by replaying the game.
## 2. If one player presents scissor and other player presents paper, scissor will win in this case since scissor can cut paper.
## 3. If one player shows rock and other player shows scissor, then rock will win
## 4. If one player shows rock and another player shows paper then the paper will win.
