## Part-A

## Rock, Paper Scissors Game:
The game consists of two players and three different hand symbols. <br>
The player can count to 3 or they can say rock/paper/scissor and present their hand symbol to the opponent. Each hand symbol has its strength and weaknesses.<br>
Rock is symbolised by a clenched fist, scissor is a horizontal V and paper is a horizontal straight hand. <br>
>Rock defeats scissor â€“ it can crush the scissor 

>Scissor defeats paper- The scissor can cut the paper

>Paper defeats rock- The paper can cover up the rock. <br>

The outcome will be either win, loss, or tie. <br>
Whatever hand symbols are presented by the players, will result in an outcome.

### 1.If two players show the same symbol the game is tied then it will go to the second scenario by replaying the game.<br>
### 2. If one player presents scissor and other player presents paper, scissor will win in this case since scissor can cut paper.<br>
### 3. If one player shows rock and other player shows scissor, then rock will win.<br>
### 4. If one player shows rock and another player shows paper then the paper will win.<br>
